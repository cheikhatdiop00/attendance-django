# Project Attendance using Outside in TDD and Django

This project try to save the attendance of a group of students registered in courses.
This action is done by a professor.

To explore the functionalities you have to create a admin user,
log in as admin (/login/admin) and create an user, courses, students.

Sometimes I had to break the rules but I tried to go in this order of implementation:
- functional test (using page objects)
- templates
- urls
- test views
- views
- test models
- models
